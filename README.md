Project Aurora is a utility that unifies RGB lighting devices across different brands and enables them to work alongside each other, all while adding and improving RGB lighting support for various games that previous had none or little RGB lighting support. Aurora is mainly written in C#, but has C++ components to implement native support for other games.

# F.A.Q.
* Q: Can this give me a ban in a video game?

   A: Support for all included games is tested to be sure not to trigger any anti-cheats or produce any suspicious behavior. With that said, the software is to be used at your own risk. We cannot prevent game developers from adding anti-cheats or blocking ways Aurora retrieves information from the game.

* Q: Are you going to support more devices?

   A: Yes, we are going to support anything that has an SDK.

* Q: Are you going to support more games?

   A: Yes, we will be looking into requested games. You can suggest/request game support  [here](https://github.com/antonpup/Aurora/issues).

* Q: Are you open to doing collaborations with other RGB projects or game companies?

   A: Definitely! If you have a project that you think can fit Aurora, feel free to send me an e-mail, iamnotaspy[at]lastbullet.net.

* Q: I would like to request support for a game, how do I do that?

   A: You can make suggestions by posting an issue [here](https://github.com/antonpup/Aurora/issues), outlining what you would like to request, and I will look over it.
   
* Q: Some keys in the program state that they are not supported. What does this mean?

   A: It means that changes to those keys are not currently possible. When it's possible to change those keys via SDK, then their support will be added.
   
* Q: Aurora is constantly crashing! Help!

   A: You can report crashes and other issues on [Github](https://github.com/antonpup/Aurora/issues). Please include a brief explanation of how to reproduce the crash and include the most recent log file. Log files can be located in the "*Aurora Location*/logs" directory.
   
* Q: I have found a bug. How do I report it?

   A: You can report bugs here, by creating a new Issue [here](https://github.com/antonpup/Aurora/issues).

* Q: I wish to expand this, fix bugs, and add my own features.

   A: Feel free to fork this repo and make pull requests with your own code. I am open for suggestions for both features and optimization. :)

* Q: What is the purpose of this utility?

   A: The main goal of Aurora is to allow RGB peripheral devices to work alongside other RGB peripheral devices from other brands. Meaning, if you own a combination of Logitech, Razer, or Corsair peripheral devices, they should be able to work together.

   Secondary goal of Aurora is to integrate RGB lighting into popular games. RGB lighting is a nifty feature that is often underused, and as a result gamers with RGB gear are unable to utilize the lighting effects that they paid for.
   
# Donations
If you want to help this project rapidly grow, you can donate via PayPal to help me further develop Aurora. While being a university student, Aurora does not take my monetary priority. Games and RGB hardware are not cheap, and as a result, support for not owned products will take more time to develop. The donations will be used to purchase hardware and videogames with intent to add support for them with Aurora. Alternatively you can gift games directly to me via Steam.

I do not have any intent in charging money for Aurora, it will always be a free and open source project.
