Please make sure you SEARCH for any other issues requesting your device before submitting your issue - it might already have been requested.

If you haven't found a similar issue, please carry on. Make sure that when you fill in the responses you delete the square brackets as comments inside these are not visible in the bug report.

To be able to add support for a particular device (keyboard, mouse, etc.), we need to be able to access an SDK. A Software Development Kit (SDK) is a code library that allows manufacturers to provide an way of controlling things with Aurora. It has various procedures programmed into it that we developers can use to send our own colour data to the keyboards or other devices. The SDK handles things such as making sure the data is in the right format, establishing a connection with the keyboard and anything else that needs to be done to make it work.

There may also be other open source projects on GitHub that we are able to use instead of needing the official SDK.

Please have a quick look on the manufacturer's website for an SDK (maybe under a section titled 'developers'). Please also search GitHub to see if there are any projects on there that might help.

Without an SDK, the only way to implement lighting in Aurora is to attempt to reverse-engineer packets of data sent from the PC software to the device, however this is a VERY SLOW PROCESS and the dev team do not have enough time to do this. If you join our Discord, we may be able to help you do this yourself if you choose to.
